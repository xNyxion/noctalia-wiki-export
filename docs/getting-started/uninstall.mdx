If you wish to remove Noctalia from your system, you can uninstall the `noctalia-shell` package using your distribution's package manager.

### Manual Installation

If you installed manually to `~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell`:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

## Cleaning Up

After removing the package, you may want to remove the configuration and cache files.

### Configuration and Cache

Noctalia stores its configuration and cache in the standard XDG directories. To remove them:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/noctalia
rm -rf ~/.cache/noctalia
```

### Generated Templates

If you enabled any templates in the **Color Scheme** settings, you will need to manually delete the generated files.

:::tip
You can find the location of the generated files by hovering over the specific template chip in **Settings > Color Scheme -> Templates**.

Hovering over any template gives you a tooltip with the location of the written file(s).
