### Autostart by your Wayland compositor
This is the recommended method for launching noctalia-shell, as it integrates with your window manager.

For the *Niri* compositor, add the following line to the end of your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`
```ini
spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "noctalia-shell"
```

For the *Hyprland* compositor, append this line to your configuration file, typically located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
```ini
exec-once = qs -c noctalia-shell
```

:::tip[Important]
- Be aware that the command might need to be adjusted based on how you installed `noctalia-shell`.
- **Manual installation**: If you installed Noctalia into `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start it. For keybindings, you must use `qs ipc ...` instead.

### Running as a Systemd Service (Advanced)
For more robust process management, you can configure Noctalia to run as a systemd user service. This approach provides automatic restarts on failure and centralizes logging with `journalctl`.

#### 1. Create the service file
First, create a new service definition file at `~/.config/systemd/user/noctalia.service` with the following content:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Noctalia Shell Service
PartOf=graphical-session.target
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=qs -c noctalia-shell
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

#### 2. Enable and Start the Service

Next, enable the service to have it start automatically with your graphical session.

If you use a compositor like Niri, it's best to tie Noctalia directly to it. This ensures they start and stop together.

```bash
# Example for Niri users
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service noctalia.service
```

Alternatively, you can enable it more generally with:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now noctalia.service
```

### Manual Launch for Debugging
The most direct way to run Noctalia for testing or debugging is to invoke it through Quickshell. Open a terminal and execute:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell
```
