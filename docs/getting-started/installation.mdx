Noctalia is packaged for [Arch Linux](#arch), [NixOS](/getting-started/nixos/), and [Gentoo](#gentoo), but can also be [installed manually](#manual-install) in other distributions.

## Arch Linux {#arch}

### Using AUR (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Noctalia on Arch Linux is through the Arch User Repository (AUR). This method installs the shell system-wide and handles dependencies automatically.

Please replace with your AUR helper of choice.

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell
```

### Development Version

For the latest features and fixes, you can install the development version directly from the Git repository:

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell-git
```

:::caution
The development version may be less stable than the official release. Use this version if you want to test the latest features or contribute to development.

## Gentoo {#gentoo}

Noctalia-shell is available in the Gentoo [Guru](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU) repository.

First enable and sync the repository as described at [Guru Information for End Users](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU/Information_for_End_Users):

```bash
# eselect repository enable guru
# emerge --sync guru
```

Next, update the [/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.accept_keywords) file/folder to enable the unstable keyword on the noctalia-shell package:

```toml
gui-apps/noctalia-shell ~amd64
```

Now the package can be installed through emerge:

```bash
# emerge gui-apps/noctalia-shell
```

Read the post-install emerge messages for information on optional dependencies and emerge them as well if desired.

For integration with systemd the package installs a user service unit to `/usr/lib/systemd/user/noctalia.service`.

## Fedora {#fedora}

Noctalia-shell is available in the [Terra](https://terra.fyralabs.com) repository.

First install the repository as described on the website:

```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

Next, install the noctalia-shell package:

```bash
sudo dnf install noctalia-shell
```

Installing noctalia-shell from Terra will automatically install all runtime dependencies and display optional dependencies.

## Manual Installation {#manual-install}

If you prefer to install Noctalia locally or want more control over the installation process, you can install it manually to your user configuration directory. This method works on any Linux distribution.

**Step 1**: Install required dependencies

For Arch Linux:

```bash
# Core dependencies (required)
paru -S quickshell gpu-screen-recorder brightnessctl

# Desktop monitor brightness (may cause instability with some monitors)
paru -S ddcutil

# Optional dependencies
paru -S cliphist matugen-git cava wlsunset xdg-desktop-portal python3 evolution-data-server

# Polkit agent (can be any other agent)
paru -S polkit-kde-agent
```

For other distributions, install the equivalent packages using your package manager.

**Step 2**: Download and install Noctalia

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell && curl -sL https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/releases/latest/download/noctalia-latest.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

### Dependencies Explained

**Required:**

- `quickshell` - Core shell framework
- `gpu-screen-recorder` - Screen recording functionality
- `brightnessctl` - Internal/laptop monitor brightness control

**Hardware-specific:**

- `ddcutil` - Desktop monitor brightness control (⚠️ may introduce system instability with certain monitors)

**Optional but recommended:**

- `cliphist` - Clipboard history support
- `matugen-git` - Material You color scheme generation
- `cava` - Audio visualizer component
- `wlsunset` - Night light functionality
- `xdg-desktop-portal` - Enables "Portal" option in screen recorder
- `python3`, `evolution-data-server` - Calendar events
- `polkit-kde-agent` - Only needed to authenticate Battery Manager installation for laptop charge limits; skip if installing via Bin/battery-manager/install-battery-manager.sh with sudo.

:::tip
Manual installation keeps Noctalia contained within your user directory, making it easy to remove or update without affecting system packages.
:::

:::note
The configuration files are saved in `~/.config/noctalia/` and the cache files are saved in `~/.cache/noctalia/`.
