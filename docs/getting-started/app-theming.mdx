## Color Sources

Noctalia supports two ways to generate color schemes:

### Wallpaper Colors

When enabled, Noctalia uses **Matugen** to extract colors from your wallpaper and generate a Material You color scheme.

- Automatically updates when you change wallpapers
- Creates harmonious colors based on your wallpaper
- Requires `matugen` package

### Predefined Schemes

Choose from carefully crafted color schemes:

- **Noctalia (default)** - The original Noctalia color palette
- **Noctalia (legacy)** - Classic Noctalia colors
- **Tokyo Night** - Popular dark theme
and many more!

:::note
Predefined schemes work without Matugen and provide consistent colors regardless of your wallpaper (except for custom templates).
