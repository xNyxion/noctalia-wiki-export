import ImageLightbox from '../../../../components/ImageLightbox.astro';
import option1 from '../../../../assets/niri-overview/option1.png';
import option2 from '../../../../assets/niri-overview/option2.png';
import option3 from '../../../../assets/niri-overview/option3.png';

Add the following settings to your Niri configuration file (usually located at `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`).

These settings are for general window appearance and functionality.

```ini
window-rule {
  // Rounded corners for a modern look.
  geometry-corner-radius 20

  // Clips window contents to the rounded corner boundaries.
  clip-to-geometry true
}

debug {
  // Allows notification actions and window activation from Noctalia.
  honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial
}
```

## Wallpapers setup

Next, choose one of the following options for your wallpaper and overview setup.

:::note
The "backdrop" in Niri is a layer behind all workspaces that is visible when you trigger the overview mode.
:::

### Option 1: Blurred Overview Wallpaper

This minimal configuration allows you to have a blurred and dimmed copy of your wallpaper that appears only in Niri's overview.

<ImageLightbox src={option1} alt="Blurred Overview Wallpaper" />

```ini
// Set the overview wallpaper on the backdrop.
layer-rule {
  match namespace="^noctalia-overview*"
  place-within-backdrop true
}
```
:::note
Option 1 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned ON in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab. It also uses more memory as it handles an extra wallpaper per monitor.
:::

### Option 2: Stationary Wallpaper

If you prefer a stationary wallpaper that is visible at all times and does not scroll when switching workspaces, use the following configuration.

<ImageLightbox src={option2} alt="Stationary Wallpaper" />

```ini
// Set the regular wallpaper on the backdrop.
layer-rule {
  match namespace="^noctalia-wallpaper*"
  place-within-backdrop true
}

// Set transparent workspace background color so you see the backdrop at all times.
layout {
  background-color "transparent"
}

// Optionally, disable the workspace shadows in the overview.
overview {
  workspace-shadow {
    off
  }
}
```
:::note
Option 2 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned OFF in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab.
:::

### Option 3: Flat Colored Overview

If you prefer a more productivity-oriented look, you can use this minimal configuration.

<ImageLightbox src={option3} alt="Flat colored overview" />

```
overview {
  // Choose your favorite color.
  backdrop-color "#26233a"
}
```

:::note
Option 3 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned OFF in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab.
