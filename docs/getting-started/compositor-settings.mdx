For the best experience with Noctalia, you'll need to configure your compositor with some specific settings.

## Niri configuration

Add the following settings to your Niri configuration file (usually located at ~/.config/niri/config.kdl).

These settings are for general window appearance and functionality.

```ini
window-rule {
  // Rounded corners for a modern look.
  geometry-corner-radius 20

  // Clips window contents to the rounded corner boundaries.
  clip-to-geometry true  
}

debug {
  // Allows notification actions and window activation from Noctalia.
  honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial 
}
```

## Niri wallpaper and overview setup

Next choose one of the following options for your wallpaper and overview setup.

:::note
The "backdrop" in Niri is a layer behind all workspaces that is visible when you trigger the overview mode.
:::

### Option 1: Blurred Overview Wallpaper

This minimal configuration allows you to have a blurred and dimmed copy of your wallpaper that appears only in Niri's overview.

![Blurred Overview Wallpaper](../../../assets/niri-overview/option1.png)

```ini
// Set the overview wallpaper on the backdrop.
layer-rule {
  match namespace="^noctalia-overview*"
  place-within-backdrop true
}
```
:::note
Option 1 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned ON in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab.  It also uses more memory as it handles an extra wallpaper per monitor.
:::

### Option 2: Stationary Wallpaper
If you prefer a stationary wallpaper that is visible at all times and that does not scroll when switching workspaces, use the following configuration.

![Stationary Wallpaper](../../../assets/niri-overview/option2.png)

```ini
// Set the regular wallpaper on the backdrop.
layer-rule {
  match namespace="^noctalia-wallpaper*"
  place-within-backdrop true
}

// Set transparent workspace background color so you see the backdrop at all times.
layout {
  background-color "transparent"
}

// Optionally, disable the workspace shadows in the overview.
overview {
  workspace-shadow {
    off
  }
}
```
:::note
Option 2 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned OFF in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab.
:::


### Option 3: Flat colored overview

If you prefer a more productivity oriented look, you can use this minimal configuration.

![Flat colored overview](../../../assets/niri-overview/option3.png)

```
overview {
  // Choose your favorite color.
  backdrop-color "#26233a"
}
```

:::note
Option 3 requires "Enable overview wallpaper" to be turned OFF in Noctalia's settings on the Wallpaper tab.
