This guide covers theming applications built with GTK, Qt, and KDE Plasma toolkits.

## GTK 3/4 Applications

GTK applications include most GNOME apps and many Linux applications. Noctalia can automatically theme them using the `adw-gtk3` theme.

### Setup

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   # Arch Linux / Manjaro
   paru -S adw-gtk-theme nwg-look
   
   # Other distributions
   # Install adw-gtk-theme and nwg-look from your package manager
   ```

2. **Apply the GTK theme:**
   - **Using nwg-look (recommended):**
     - Open `nwg-look`
     - Select `adw-gtk3` from the theme list
     - Click "Apply"
     - ![nwg-look](../../../../assets/app-theming/nwg-look.png)
   
   - **Using command line:**
     ```bash
     gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'adw-gtk3'
     ```

3. **Enable GTK theming in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates**
   - Toggle on **GTK**

### Troubleshooting

- **Theme not applying:** Completely restart GTK applications (close and reopen)
- **Some apps still look wrong:** Some GTK apps may need GTK 4 theme separately:
  ```bash
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'adw-gtk3'
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'  # or 'prefer-light'
  ```
- **Flatpak apps:** Flatpak apps may need the theme installed in their sandbox:
  ```bash
  flatpak install org.gtk.Gtk3theme.adw-gtk3-dark
  flatpak install org.gtk.Gtk3theme.adw-gtk3
  ```

## Qt Applications

Qt applications include KDE apps and many cross-platform applications. Noctalia themes them through `qt6ct`.

### Setup

1. **Install qt6ct:**
   ```bash
   # Arch Linux / Manjaro
   paru -S qt6ct
   
   # Other distributions
   # Install qt6ct from your package manager
   ```

2. **Set environment variable:**
   Add this to your window manager configuration or shell profile:
   
   **For Niri (`config.kdl`):**
   ```kdl
   environment {
     QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME "qt6ct"
   }
   ```
   
   **For Hyprland (`hyprland.conf`):**
   ```conf
   env = QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,qt6ct
   ```
   
   **For Sway (`config`):**
   ```bash
   setenv QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME qt6ct
   ```
   
   **For shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):**
   ```bash
   export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct
   ```

3. **Enable Qt theming in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates**
   - Toggle on **Qt**

4. **Configure qt6ct:**
   - Run `qt6ct` from terminal
   - Go to **Color Scheme** tab
   - Select `noctalia` from the dropdown
   - Click **Apply** and **OK**

### Troubleshooting

- **Qt apps not themed:** Ensure the environment variable is set before launching applications
- **qt6ct not found:** Make sure qt6ct is installed and in your PATH
- **Theme not updating:** Restart Qt applications after changing color schemes

## KDE Plasma (KColorScheme)

If you're using KDE Plasma, Noctalia can apply colors through the native KColorScheme system.

### Setup

1. **Enable KColorScheme in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates**
   - Toggle on **KColorScheme**

2. **Apply in KDE System Settings:**
   - Open **System Settings → Appearance → Colors**
   - Select the `noctalia` color scheme
   - The scheme will update automatically when you change colors in Noctalia

### Troubleshooting

- **Scheme not appearing:** Restart KDE Plasma or log out and back in
- **Colors not updating:** Ensure KColorScheme toggle is enabled in Noctalia settings
