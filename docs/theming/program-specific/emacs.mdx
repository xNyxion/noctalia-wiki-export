Emacs can be themed using the Noctalia color scheme through the built-in theme system.

## Setup

1. **Enable Emacs theming in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates → Programs**
   - Toggle on **Emacs**

2. **Add the theme to your Emacs configuration:**
   Add the following line to your Emacs configuration file (typically `~/.emacs.d/config.el`, or `~/.config/doom/config.el`):
   
   ```elisp
   (load-theme 'noctalia t)
   ```
   
   The `t` argument enables the theme immediately and disables any previously active themes.

:::note
If you get an error saying `noctalia-theme` can't be found, you may need to add the themes directory to your load path before loading the theme. The exact path may vary depending on your Emacs configuration:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.config/emacs/themes/")
(load-theme 'noctalia t)
```
:::

3. **Reload your configuration:**
   - Restart Emacs, or
   - Evaluate the expression: `M-x eval-buffer` or `C-x C-e` after the line

## Configuration Example

Here's a complete example of how to add it to your `config.el`:

```elisp
;; Load Noctalia theme
(load-theme 'noctalia t)
```

You can also add it conditionally or after other configurations:

```elisp
;; Load Noctalia theme after startup
(add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda () (load-theme 'noctalia t)))
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Theme not found:** Ensure that Emacs theming is enabled in Noctalia settings and that the theme files are being generated correctly. If the files exist but aren't found, add `(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.config/emacs/themes/")` before `(load-theme 'noctalia t)`.
- **Theme not applying:** Make sure you've added `(load-theme 'noctalia t)` to your Emacs configuration file
- **Colors not updating:** Restart Emacs or reload your configuration after changing color schemes in Noctalia
- **Theme conflicts:** The `t` argument in `load-theme` disables other themes. If you want to keep other themes, you may need to adjust your configuration

## Additional Notes

The Noctalia theme for Emacs integrates with Noctalia's color scheme system. When you change color schemes in Noctalia, the Emacs theme will be regenerated to match. You'll need to reload the theme in Emacs to see the changes:

```elisp
(load-theme 'noctalia t)
```

Or use `M-x load-theme` and select `noctalia` from the list.
