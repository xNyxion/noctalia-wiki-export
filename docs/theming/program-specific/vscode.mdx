Visual Studio Code can be themed using the NoctaliaTheme extension, which syncs with Noctalia's color scheme.

## Setup

1. **Install the NoctaliaTheme extension:**
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for **"NoctaliaTheme"**
   - Click **Install** from the marketplace

2. **Enable VSCode theming in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates**
   - Toggle on **VSCode**

3. **Select the theme in VSCode:**
   - Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
   - Type "Preferences: Color Theme"
   - Select **NoctaliaTheme**


## How It Works

The extension reads the color scheme generated by Noctalia's color schemes integration. When you change color schemes in Noctalia, the theme in VSCode will automatically update to match.

## Troubleshooting

- **Theme not appearing:** Make sure you've installed the "NoctaliaTheme" extension from the VSCode marketplace
- **Colors not updating:** The theme should update automatically when Noctalia generates new colors. If it doesn't, try:
  - Reloading the VSCode window (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")
  - Switching to a different theme and back to NoctaliaTheme
- **Theme looks broken:** Ensure you have the latest version of the extension and that Noctalia's templates are generating correctly

## Additional Notes

NoctaliaTheme integrates directly with Noctalia's color scheme system, providing a seamless theming experience across your desktop and code editor. The theme supports both dark and light modes based on your Noctalia color scheme settings.
