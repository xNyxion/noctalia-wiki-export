Visual Studio Code can be themed using the HyprLuna Matugen Theme extension, which syncs with Noctalia's color scheme.

## Setup

1. **Install the HyprLuna Matugen Theme extension:**
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for **"HyprLuna Matugen Theme"**
   - Click **Install** from the marketplace

2. **Enable VSCode theming in Noctalia:**
   - Open **Settings → Color Scheme → Templates**
   - Toggle on **VSCode**

3. **Select the theme in VSCode:**
   - Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
   - Type "Preferences: Color Theme"
   - Select **HyprLuna Matugen Theme** (or **HyprLuna Matugen Theme Dark/Light**)

## How It Works

The HyprLuna Matugen Theme extension reads the color scheme generated by Noctalia's Matugen integration. When you change color schemes in Noctalia, the theme in VSCode will automatically update to match.

## Troubleshooting

- **Theme not appearing:** Make sure you've installed the "HyprLuna Matugen Theme" extension from the VSCode marketplace
- **Colors not updating:** The theme should update automatically when Noctalia generates new colors. If it doesn't, try:
  - Reloading VSCode window (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
  - Switching to a different theme and back to HyprLuna Matugen Theme
- **Theme looks broken:** Ensure you have the latest version of the extension and that Noctalia's Matugen templates are generating correctly

## Additional Notes

The HyprLuna Matugen Theme integrates directly with Noctalia's color scheme system, providing a seamless theming experience across your desktop and code editor. The theme supports both dark and light modes based on your Noctalia color scheme settings.
