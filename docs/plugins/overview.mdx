description: Learn how to create plugins for Noctalia Shell
---

Noctalia Shell features a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend the shell with custom functionality. Plugins are written in QML and can integrate seamlessly with the shell's UI and services.

## What Can Plugins Do?

Plugins can provide several types of components:

### Bar Widgets
Add custom widgets to the top/bottom bar. Examples:
- Display system information
- Show custom indicators
- Quick action buttons
- Status monitors

### Panels
Create overlay panels that can be opened from bar widgets or other triggers. Panels are full-screen overlays with custom UI.

### Main Logic
Run background logic using IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handlers to:
- Process external commands
- Monitor system events
- Perform background tasks
- Integrate with external services

### Settings UI
Provide a settings interface that integrates with Noctalia's settings panel, allowing users to configure your plugin.

## Plugin Architecture

Plugins in Noctalia follow a modular architecture:

```
your-plugin/
├── manifest.json      # Plugin metadata (required)
├── preview.png        # Preview image for plugin gallery (optional, recommended)
├── Main.qml           # Background logic with IPC handlers (optional)
├── BarWidget.qml      # Bar widget component (optional)
├── Panel.qml          # Panel overlay component (optional)
├── Settings.qml       # Settings UI component (optional)
├── settings.json      # User settings data (auto-generated)
├── i18n/              # Translations (optional)
│   ├── en.json
│   └── es.json
└── README.md          # Plugin documentation
```

:::tip[Preview Images]
Add a `preview.png`, `preview.jpg`, `preview.jpeg`, or `preview.webp` file to your plugin folder to display a preview image in the plugin gallery. The preview image should showcase what your plugin does or how it looks. Recommended size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio. If no preview image is provided, a placeholder will be shown instead.

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Installation**: Plugin is downloaded from a registry to `~/.config/noctalia/plugins/`
2. **Registration**: PluginRegistry scans the folder and validates the manifest
3. **Enabling**: User enables the plugin in settings
4. **Loading**: PluginService loads the plugin components and injects the Plugin API
5. **Running**: Plugin components receive `pluginApi` property with access to services
6. **Settings**: Users can configure the plugin through the integrated settings UI
7. **Unloading**: When disabled, the plugin is cleanly unloaded
8. **Uninstallation**: Plugin folder is removed from disk

## Plugin API

Every plugin component receives a `pluginApi` object with access to:

- **pluginId**: Unique plugin identifier
- **pluginDir**: Plugin directory path
- **pluginSettings**: User settings object
- **manifest**: Plugin manifest data
- **saveSettings()**: Save settings to disk
- **openPanel(screen)**: Open the plugin's panel
- **closePanel(screen)**: Close the plugin's panel
- **tr(key, interpolations)**: Translate text
- **trp(key, count, ...)**: Translate with plurals
- **hasTranslation(key)**: Check if translation exists

Additionally, plugins have access to all Noctalia services through QML imports:
- `qs.Commons` - Settings, I18n, Logger, Style, Color
- `qs.Services.UI` - ToastService, PanelService, TooltipService
- `qs.Services.System` - AudioService, BatteryService, NetworkService, etc.
- `qs.Widgets` - All Noctalia UI widgets (NButton, NIcon, NText, etc.)

## Example Plugins

Check out these example plugins in the [official repository](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-plugins):

- **hello-world**: Demonstrates all plugin features (bar widget, panel, settings, IPC)
- **launcher-button**: Simple bar widget that opens the app launcher
- **privacy-indicator**: Shows when mic/camera/screen sharing is active
