description: Learn how to create plugins for Noctalia Shell
---

Noctalia Shell features a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend the shell with custom functionality. Plugins are written in QML and can integrate seamlessly with the shell's UI and services.

## What Can Plugins Do?

Plugins can provide several types of components, each serving different purposes:

### Bar Widgets
Add custom widgets to the top/bottom bar that provide quick access to information and actions.

**Use cases:**
- Display system information (CPU, memory, network)
- Show custom indicators (notifications, status)
- Quick action buttons (launcher, shortcuts)
- Status monitors (battery, time, weather)

**Learn more:** [Bar Widget Development](/plugins/bar-widget/)

### Desktop widgets 
Add custom widgets to your desktop background. They provide at-a-glance information and can be positioned and scaled by the user in edit mode.

**Use cases:**
- Clock, MediaPlayer 
- Weather forecast
- Audio visualizers

**Learn more:** [Desktop Widget Development](/plugins/desktop-widget/)


### Panels
Create full-screen overlay panels that can be opened from bar widgets or triggered programmatically.

**Use cases:**
- Detailed information displays
- Complex UI interactions
- Configuration interfaces
- Content browsers and lists

**Learn more:** [Panel Development](/plugins/panel/)

### Main Component
Run background logic and handle IPC (Inter-Process Communication) commands. Optional component for plugins that need background processing.

**Use cases:**
- Process external commands via IPC
- Monitor system events
- Perform background tasks
- Integrate with external services

**Learn more:** [IPC Guide](/plugins/ipc/)

### Settings UI
Provide a settings interface that integrates with Noctalia's settings panel, allowing users to configure your plugin.

**Use cases:**
- User configuration
- Plugin customization
- Feature toggles
- Preferences management

**Learn more:** [Settings UI Guide](/plugins/settings/) *(coming soon)*

## Plugin Architecture

Plugins in Noctalia follow a modular architecture:

```
your-plugin/
├── manifest.json      # Plugin metadata (required)
├── preview.png        # Preview image for plugin gallery (optional, recommended)
├── Main.qml           # Background logic with IPC handlers (optional)
├── BarWidget.qml      # Bar widget component (optional)
├── DesktopWidget.qml  # Desktop widget component (optional)
├── Panel.qml          # Panel overlay component (optional)
├── Settings.qml       # Settings UI component (optional)
├── i18n/              # Translations (optional)
│   ├── en.json
│   └── es.json
├── README.md          # Plugin documentation
└── settings.json      # User saved settings (should not be committed to the repository)
```

:::tip[Preview Images]
Add a `preview.png`, `preview.jpg`, `preview.jpeg`, or `preview.webp` file to your plugin folder to display a preview image in the plugin gallery. The preview image should showcase what your plugin does or how it looks. Recommended size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio. If no preview image is provided, a placeholder will be shown instead.

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Installation**: Plugin is downloaded from a registry to `~/.config/noctalia/plugins/`
2. **Registration**: PluginRegistry scans the folder and validates the manifest
3. **Enabling**: User enables the plugin in settings
4. **Loading**: PluginService loads the plugin components and injects the Plugin API
5. **Running**: Plugin components receive `pluginApi` property with access to services
6. **Settings**: Users can configure the plugin through the integrated settings UI
7. **Unloading**: When disabled, the plugin is cleanly unloaded
8. **Uninstallation**: Plugin folder is removed from disk

## Plugin API

Every plugin component receives a `pluginApi` object that provides access to plugin functionality and Noctalia services.

### Core Properties
- **`pluginId`** - Unique plugin identifier
- **`pluginDir`** - Plugin directory path
- **`pluginSettings`** - User settings object (read/write)
- **`manifest`** - Plugin manifest data
- **`currentLanguage`** - Current UI language code
- **`mainInstance`** - Reference to the instantiated Main.qml component (null if not loaded)
- **`barWidget`** - Reference to the bar widget Component (null if not provided)

### Core Functions
- **`saveSettings()`** - Persist settings to disk
- **`openPanel(screen)`** - Open the plugin's panel
- **`closePanel(screen)`** - Close the plugin's panel
- **`tr(key, interpolations)`** - Translate text
- **`trp(key, count, ...)`** - Translate with plurals
- **`hasTranslation(key)`** - Check if translation exists

### Noctalia Services

Plugins have full access to Noctalia's service ecosystem:

**`qs.Commons`** - Core utilities
- `Settings` - Global Noctalia settings
- `I18n` - Internationalization
- `Logger` - Logging utilities
- `Style` - Design system constants
- `Color` - Theme-aware colors

**`qs.Services.UI`** - UI services
- `ToastService` - Toast notifications
- `PanelService` - Panel management
- `TooltipService` - Tooltip display

**`qs.Services.System`** - System services
- `AudioService` - Audio control
- `BatteryService` - Battery information
- `NetworkService` - Network status
- And many more...

**`qs.Widgets`** - UI components
- `NButton`, `NIcon`, `NText`, `NTextInput`
- `NScrollView`, `NColorPicker`, and more
