Noctalia provides a built-in settings interface that makes configuration easy and accessible. You can configure almost every aspect of the shell through the graphical user interface.

### Accessing the Settings

You can open the Noctalia settings in several ways:

1. **From the Control Center**: Click the settings icon in the control center panel
2. **From the Bar**: Right-Click on the bar to access the Control Center then click on the settings button
3. **Using keybinds**: Search for "Settings" in the [Keybinds Reference](/getting-started/keybinds/)

All settings are organized into intuitive categories, allowing you to customize:
- General appearance and behavior
- Theming and colors
- Bar configuration and widgets
- Panel settings
- Notifications
- And much more

Changes take effect immediately, and all settings are automatically saved.
